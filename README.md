# PISS

**P**ersonal **I**nformation **S**torage and **S**yndication

Increasingly, our digital selves are spread out across a myriad of social networks and there is no central repository of the things that interest you. **PISS** aims to change that. This project borrows many ideas from [IndieWebCamp](http://indiewebcamp.com/) and [Tantek Ã‡elik](http://tantek.com/), but tries not to hold them as dogma.

A public repository of this app can be found here: https://github.com/jenmontes/piss. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/jenmontes/piss/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests, and submitting pull requests.
